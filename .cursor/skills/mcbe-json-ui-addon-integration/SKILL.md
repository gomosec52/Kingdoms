# MCBE JSON UI Addon Integration

Use this when the UI depends on the wider pack.

## Workflow

1. Read `references/addon-map.md`.
2. Identify the non-UI dependency:
   - textures
   - font
   - blocks
   - attachables
   - entity visuals
3. Explain how the UI depends on that layer.
4. If the task is only about UI structure, switch back to the narrower skill.

## Focus

- RPG Server UI Reference is the main included addon-integration source.
- Farm UI Variants is secondary and broader.
