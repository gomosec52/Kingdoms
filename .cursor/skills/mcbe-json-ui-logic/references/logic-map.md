- optional local binding dump snapshots can confirm names such as `#text_box_item_name`, `#hover_text`, `#text`, `#text_tts`, `#texture`, and `#texture_file_system`; use them as lookup aids, not as runtime proof

## What these prove

- title text can be reused as a data channel
- actionbar text can trigger alternative UI
- server form titles can act as routing keys
- fixed-width substring extraction is a common Bedrock UI pattern
- `%.s` string formatting can trim and pad payload fields without scripts; see `mcbe-json-ui-master/references/topics/logic/text-formatting-and-slicing.md`
- first-line extraction and hover-text trimming are marker protocols and must be tested with UTF-8 section-sign markers
- Java Locate Command parsing shows how `chat_screen.json` can parse `The nearest ... is at block ...` locate messages into coordinates and a `/tp @s` edit-box command; see `../../../references/topics/logic/java-locate-command-bindings.md`
- progress bars often depend on preserved text panels
- binding dumps and dynamic form library examples are useful for discovering names and reusable search/slice expressions
